      This is a game of battleship. You can play against the computer or against
      another player. The game is played on a 10x10 grid. Each player has 5 ships
      to place on the grid. The ships are: 1 aircraft carrier (5 spaces), 1
      battleship (4 spaces), 1 submarine (3 spaces), 1 destroyer (3 spaces), and 1
      patrol boat (2 spaces). The ships can be placed horizontally or vertically
      on the grid. The ships cannot overlap or be placed diagonally. The game is
